## To do

- figures
    - pretty labels in Rsq/coef plots
    - faceting (i.e. compact multi-panel plots by suppressing redundant scales/axis labels)
- continue writing methods
- fire comparisons
    - combined fire R^2 with `cmp_R2`
	- zero-fire predictions

### low

- figure out amphibian intercept shift???
- R-squared: does "full model" Rsq include random effects??

- all-fire-excluded: R^2
- 
## Cleanup

- finish cleaning up pipeline
	- allfit
	   - re-add checkpointing
	   - parallelize at lower level?
	   - separate `utils.R` into model-fitting and downstream?
- divide document into backend/frontend (update table of contents?)

## Long-term/wishlist

- get everything working with brms?
